## 💻 Projects

### 🗺️ Access to Everyday Life: Seattle Sidewalk Accessibility  
*Dubstech Datathon 2026 | Data Analysis & Visualization*  
🔗 https://reneeemlee.github.io/dubstech-datathon-2026/

- Analyzed Seattle sidewalk accessibility using **Project Sidewalk** and **Seattle GeoData** datasets.
- Investigated the **severity, frequency, and spatial distribution** of accessibility barriers across neighborhoods.
- Developed an **Accessibility Score** to quantify neighborhood-level mobility challenges.
- Identified clustering of high-barrier areas, highlighting **systemic infrastructure inequities**.
- Found the **Industrial District** to have the highest overall accessibility burden, indicating a priority area for intervention.
- Created **interactive Tableau dashboards** to communicate findings clearly to non-technical audiences.

**Tools:** Tableau Public, data cleaning, spatial analysis  
**Team:** Renée Lee, Celine Chen, Heidi Ngo  

### 🌍 Disaster Relief Allocation System (Java)
- Implemented a **recursive algorithm** to explore feasible allocations of limited resources across regions.
- Modeled **population and cost constraints** to maximize the number of people helped within a fixed budget.
- Designed **tie-breaking logic** to prioritize cost-efficiency when multiple optimal solutions existed.
- Pruned invalid solution paths when allocations exceeded budget constraints to improve performance.

### 🧠 Data Representation & Systems Programming (C)
- Implemented a custom **bitmask-based data representation** to manage store inventory.
- Used **bitwise operators, shifts, and masks** to extract and update packed data fields.
- Managed memory using **pointers and arrays** across multiple data structures.
- Designed and tested systems-level functions to refill inventory, fulfill orders, and analyze item distribution.
